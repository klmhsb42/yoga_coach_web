## Abstract

*Yoga Coach web* is a web app that allows you to record your body pose with your webcam and will give you feedback how good your doing on a certain exercise based on coputer vision analysis. This app was developed as my final project during the data science bootcamp at [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/de/program/data-science) in Berlin. If you dont' want to setup by yourself, you can have a look at the screenshots.

## How to setup

1) Clone the repository: `git clone`
2) Create a virtual envrionment: `git clone`
3) Update the virtual envrionment: `git clone`
4) Install required python packages inside the virtual envrionment: `git clone`
5) Go inside the repository folder: `git clone`
6) Run the app: `git clone`

## How to use

To use *Yoga Coach web* is intuitive. To start, just select the exercise you want to start with using the "Prev"/"Next" buttons and press the "Start" button. Place your computer so that your full body is visible in the webcam. Then, try to perform the exercise and listen to the feedback.
